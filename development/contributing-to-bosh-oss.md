# Contributing to BOSH OSS

BOSH is open source and a relatively young piece of software. You may quickly want to help and contribute to the project. Nod and say, "yes I do."

Whether its small documentation changes, bug fixes or new features, you will bask in a warm glow from sharing your fixes with others. Perhaps earn yourself a [Nerd Merit Badge](http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/products/octocat "Nerd Merit Badges - 01: Open Source").
